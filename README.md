# Front-end-EN-P11-Search-Engine
This is project 7 of Openclassrooms front-end path<br/>
I've created two branches, one for functional methods (forEach, map, ...etc) which named as <strong>functional-algorithm</strong>.<br/>
The second branch is for regular loops (for, while, ...etc).<br/>
Here's a live demo: https://p7-searchtool-alihammad.netlify.app/
